# Week 6 - SQL 2
This week, we continue to explore SQLite diving into more complex queries.

## Lab Sructure
1. As usual, we will go over a [Walkthrough](walkthrough/SQL2_Walkthrough.ipynb) in which we'll work on more complex queries than last week.
2. Then you will complete an [exercise](Exercises/Exercises_week_6.ipynb) in breakout rooms.
