# Clustering

Welcome to the very last lab! This week you will learn how to cluster. For this, you will use both K-means and hierarchical clustering.

As always, there you will first get the chance to familiarize yourself with the material in the [walkthrough](Walkthrough/Clustering_Walkthrough.ipynb) and then practice your skills in the [exercise](Exercises/Clustering_Exercise.ipynb).

**Note:** Clustering is very computation-intensive, which is why some cells in both the walkthrough and the exercise take a bit of time to run. This is especially true for questions 2 (~2 mins) and 7 (~10 mins) of the exercise. While these cells run, you can simply assume that your code is correct (if no error code shows up in the first seconds) and look at the next questions. This means that you can fill the dots ( ... ) without running the cells while waiting for the other, computation-intensive, cell to display its full output.
