# Pandas and EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Goals
- You will become familiar with using Pandas for applying important concepts in EDA: 
    - summary statistics, 
    - boxplots, 
    - correlations and pairplots.
- We will also see how to get data from a webpage through **web-scraping**.


## Lab Structure

1. Walkthrough1: EDA with Pandas (+some small exercises) and Webscraping

## Exercises
1. Answer on your own the questions in [Exercise1](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week3%20-%20Pandas%20-%20Data%20Cleaning/Exercises/Exercise1_week3.ipynb)

2. Advanced: If you want an extra challenge, complete the different EDA tasks in this exercise [Exercise2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/michalis0/Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics/blob/master/week3%20-%20Pandas%20-%20Data%20Cleaning/Exercises/Exercise2_week3.ipynb)
