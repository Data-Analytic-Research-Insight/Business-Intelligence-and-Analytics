# Pandas and EDA

## Goals
- You will become familiar with using Pandas for applying important concepts in EDA: 
    - summary statistics, 
    - boxplots, 
    - correlations and pairplots.
- We will also see how to get data from a webpage through **web-scraping**.


## Lab Structure

1. Walkthrough1: EDA with Pandas (+some small exercises)
2. Walkthrough2: Webscraping
