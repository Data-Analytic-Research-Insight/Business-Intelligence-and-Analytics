# Week 5 - SQL

This week we will cover SQL, which most of you should already be familiar with. Unlike during your first year of bachelor, we will not use SQL Explorer. In fact, you will learn how you can run SQL querries in a Python notebook using SQLite.

### Lab Structure
1. We will revisit all of the basic concepts of SQL and teach you how to use SQLite in the [Walkthrough](walkthrough/SQL1_Walkthrough.ipynb).
2. You will have 15-20 minutes to complete [exercise 1](exercices/SQL1_EX1.ipynb).
3. You will have 15-20 minutes to complete [exercise 2](exercices/SQL1_EX2.ipynb).

### Further Documentation
For those of you that have never used SQL, we can recommend following the short course at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-sql) to get up to speed.

If you encounter any difficulties or problems, [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) is very informative about all of the different functions you might use.
