Therefore, they implemeted a comprehensive academic refore package designed to improve the academic success and graduation of all student-athletes. The centerpiece of the academic reform package was the development of a real-time academic measurement for sports teams, known as the Academic Progress Rate (APR).\n",

Additionally, student-athletes can be ruled ineligible to play if they demonstrate poor academic performances.\n",
