# Association Rules

In this week's lab, we are going to learn about how to perform market basket analysis for finingd frequent itemsets and how to mine for association rules, using the Python library `mlxtend`. You will also become familiar with the notions of support, confidence and lift and see an application of the apriori algorithm.
